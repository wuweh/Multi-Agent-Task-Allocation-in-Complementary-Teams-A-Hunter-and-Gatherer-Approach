%     This code is a multi-agent task allocation analysis platform.
%     A game-theoretic decision-making approach has been utilized in this code.
%     This project aims to investigate the effect of using heterogeneous groups of robots,
%     with different capabilities, to accomplish a set of sub-tasks in order to improve efficiency.
